# React Shopping Cart

A Shopping cart built w/ Next, TypeScript, Chakra-ui

## TODO

- A search bar in the top with debounce
- drawer from bottom with **add to cart** option
- a toast saying, **added to cart**
- move the bottom drawer to a component

## Ultimate goal

when a product is clicked, a drawer should swipe from bottom to upward (similar to how you would see in an **ios app**, and there should be a **add to cart** button, upon clicking on **add to cart**, a toast should be shown which says, **product added to cart**)

And the product is then shown in cart, **normal**
